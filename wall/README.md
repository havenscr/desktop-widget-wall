# Wall 2

Wall 2 is the next front end for Widget Wall. It lives beside the existing app
(`src/`, untouched) and is built with Vite, React and TypeScript (strict). It
runs in a plain browser for development and inside Tauri as a second app,
"Widget Wall 2". This is the scaffold: a scaled stage, a placeholder horizon, a
left rail with three places, a clock, a small Tauri bridge and tests. Real
screens arrive in later pull requests.

## Requirements

Node 22 or newer and npm. Nothing else is needed for the web side. The Tauri
build also needs Rust and the Windows toolchain; CI does that on a Windows
runner, so you rarely need it locally.

## Run, test, build (web)

All commands run from the repository root (or `cd wall` and drop `--prefix wall`).

```bash
npm --prefix wall ci            # install exact dependencies
npm --prefix wall run dev       # dev server at http://localhost:1421
npm --prefix wall run typecheck # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm --prefix wall test          # vitest run (jsdom)
npm --prefix wall run build     # type check, then vite build into wall/dist
npm --prefix wall run preview   # serve wall/dist
```

In a browser there is no Tauri. `src/bridge/tauri.ts` then answers `invoke`
from a mock table (`mocks`); fill it from tests or dev code. An unknown command
rejects with a clear error. Inside Tauri, `invoke` calls the real command.

## Run and build inside Tauri

`src-tauri/tauri.wall2.conf.json` is a second Tauri config. It overrides only
the product name ("Widget Wall 2"), identifier, version, the `build` block
(dev URL `http://localhost:1421`, build commands, `frontendDist` at
`wall/dist`) and one window (2560 by 720, resizable, no decorations, not always
on top). Everything else comes from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

```bash
npm ci                  # root install, provides the Tauri CLI
npm run dev:wall2       # tauri dev with the second config
npm run build:wall2     # tauri build with the second config (installers)
```

`build:wall2` runs `npm --prefix wall ci && npm --prefix wall run build` first.
The old app is unchanged: `npm run tauri build` still builds "Widget Wall".

## Where things are

- Design surface: `wall/src/stage/fitScale.ts` holds `STAGE_WIDTH` (2560),
  `STAGE_HEIGHT` (720) and the pure `fitScale(windowWidth, windowHeight)`. The
  scale is `min(width / 2560, height / 720)`, exactly 1 at 2560 by 720.
  `wall/src/stage/Stage.tsx` applies it with a CSS transform and recomputes on
  resize. Lay out everything in design pixels inside the stage.
- Horizon: `wall/src/horizon/index.ts` (`drawHorizon`, `HorizonOptions`) and
  `HorizonCanvas.tsx`. The backing store is stage scale times
  `devicePixelRatio`. Placeholder gradients only for now.
- Tokens and fonts: `wall/src/styles/tokens.css`, fonts and their licences in
  `wall/src/assets/fonts/`.
- Rail and places: `wall/src/rail/Rail.tsx`, store in `wall/src/state/places.ts`.
- Clock: `wall/src/clock/` (takes an injectable `now`).
- Tests sit next to the code as `*.test.ts(x)`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` has a `wall-web` job (Ubuntu: install,
type check, test, build) and, in the Windows job, a second build uploaded as
the `widget-wall-2-windows` artifact.
